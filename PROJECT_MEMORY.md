## Product identity

**MoxDOP** (DOP — Dijital Operasyon Platformu) is an **internal digital operations platform for Moximu**.

It is **not**:

- SaaS
- a customer / client portal
- a subscription / billing product
- a marketplace / plugin ZIP store
- a multi-tenant Workspace product

Operators are agency owners and agency staff only. Customers do **not** log in.

Canonical operational hierarchy:

```text
Customer
→ Brand
→ Digital Asset
→ Integration / External Resource / Binding
→ Run
→ Evidence
→ Finding
→ Recommendation
→ Task
→ Outcome
```

Notes:

- **AI remains advisory and evidence-grounded.** AI does not invent Findings, silently override deterministic Recommendations, or auto-open Tasks.
- **External provider integrations remain READ-ONLY.** No external write actions.
- There is **no separate Result entity**. Outcomes are observed via later Evidence / Finding lifecycle and Task outcome signals.
- Single Filament panel: id `app`, path `/app`; `web` guard; `spatie/laravel-permission`.
- Modules live under `app-modules/` + `internachi/modular` (minimal registry: id + enabled/disabled).

---

## Brand / account model

One Brand **MAY** have:

- multiple Meta Ads accounts
- multiple Google Ads accounts
- multiple Digital Assets of the same provider type

**Canonical model:**

```text
ONE provider advertising account
=
ONE corresponding Ads Digital Asset
+
its provider binding
```

Do **not** force all Brand ad accounts into one Digital Asset.

Meta Business Manager / Google Manager (MCC) accounts may appear as **provider scope / container context**, but are **not** automatically equivalent to Brand.

---

## Central integration model

The agency authenticates providers **centrally**.

### Meta

```text
one central Meta Integration / agency credential
→ discover accessible Businesses / Ad Accounts
→ operator selects relevant account(s)
→ bind selected accounts to Brand Digital Assets
```

- No Meta App per customer.
- No access token per Ad Account as the primary auth model.

### Google

Follows the corresponding **central agency-auth** model (one agency Google Integration → discover resources → bind to Digital Assets).

Site-scoped legacy connection paths may still exist for some Website connectors; the **direction of travel** is central Integration + External Resource + AssetBinding.

---

## Current product philosophy

```text
Provider / raw data
→ normalized operational data / Evidence
→ deterministic Findings
→ bounded Agent + Skills
→ AI interpretation
→ human Recommendation
→ human Task
→ later read-only refresh
→ Outcome
```

Hard distinctions:

| Platform / provider signal | Must not be treated as |
| --- | --- |
| Platform result | Verified business outcome |
| Meta lead | Qualified lead |
| Messaging result | Qualified customer |
| Purchase value | Verified profit (unless supported by business / CRM Evidence) |

Platform metrics are useful operational Evidence. They are **not** automatic truth about business success.

---

## Operational Taxonomy — planned foundation

**Status: PLANNED — do not implement in this memory milestone.**

Marketing entities will eventually be classified across **independent dimensions**, not one simple category string.

Example dimensions:

- Service / Offer
- Market / Geography
- Audience Segment
- Funnel Stage
- Business Goal
- Language
- Acquisition Type

Future classification should support:

- canonical terms
- aliases
- manual assignment
- AI / rule suggestions
- human approval
- provenance
- confidence
- valid-from / valid-to where needed

---

## Marketing Initiative — planned

**Status: PLANNED — do not implement yet.**

Brand-level grouping of provider entities that represent the **same commercial effort**.

Example:

```text
Mommy Makeover | Germany | Turkish Diaspora | Lead Gen
```

could later contain:

- Meta Campaign A
- Meta Campaign B
- Google Campaign X
- relevant landing-page context

Initiatives are a future organizational layer above raw provider campaign objects.

---

## Benchmark Cohort — planned

**Status: PLANNED — do not implement yet.**

Future cross-Brand comparisons should use **approved compatible taxonomy dimensions**.

Do **not** compare semantically incompatible platform metrics merely because labels look similar.

Example: Meta CTR and Google Search CTR are **not** automatically equivalent benchmark metrics.

---

## Operational Data Foundation — next foundation direction

**Status: DOCUMENTED DIRECTION ONLY — do not implement in this milestone.**

Planned building blocks:

- Provider Entity Catalog
- Historical Performance Store
- Historical backfill
- Incremental sync
- Operational Taxonomy
- Classification assignments
- Marketing Initiative foundations
- Benchmark Cohort foundations

Desired future behavior:

```text
Brand connects provider account
→ available provider history backfilled in resumable chunks
→ normalized daily facts retained
→ incremental updates continue
→ campaigns / entities are classifiable
→ historical filtering / comparison becomes possible
→ Evidence / Findings / Outcome / learning can use the history
```

Constraints:

- Historical store is **NOT RAG**.
- Do **not** use giant Evidence JSON dumps as the primary historical warehouse.
- Prefer normalized daily / entity facts with provenance.

---

## Agency Learning — future

**Status: PLANNED — no automatic self-modifying truth.**

Controlled future learning flow:

```text
Historical Evidence
+ Recommendation
+ Task
+ later Evidence
+ Outcome
→ Learning Candidate
→ human review
→ approved Agency Knowledge
```

No automatic Skill / Agent mutation from Outcomes without human approval.

---

## Outside-in Discovery status

**Current implemented capability on main: LIMITED public Website Discovery.**

It can obtain:

- bounded public website / context signals
- optional supported competitor **candidates** (when DataForSEO is configured)
- Brand Context **candidates** for human Accept / Edit / Ignore

It is **NOT** yet:

- full web intelligence
- social intelligence
- Facebook / Instagram public intelligence
- YouTube intelligence
- review monitoring
- news / mention monitoring
- continuous web monitoring

**Never** describe current Website Discovery as “all digital web discovery.”

Canonical product doc: `docs/product/DISCOVERY_INTELLIGENCE.md`.

---

## Meta / Google intelligence (main vs unmerged)

### Google Ads Intelligence

Present on **canonical main** (module collectors, Findings, Google Ads Analyst + Skills, workspace UX).  
State details: see `PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md`. Product doc often labels this “IMPLEMENTED V1” — that means a technical version slice, **not** automatically Definition-of-Done **DONE**.

### Meta Ads Intelligence

**PR #119** (`Meta Ads Intelligence + Analyst V1`) remains **OPEN / unmerged** as of this memory snapshot.

Therefore:

- Meta Ads Intelligence exists on that PR branch
- it is **NOT** part of canonical main yet
- main has Meta **central Integration + resource discovery + binding** (connection layer; real UAT PASS claimed in product docs)
- main Meta module does **not** ship Insights collectors / Analyst intelligence

Agents must **not** claim unmerged PR functionality is on main.

---

## Definition of Done

A feature is **NOT** considered **DONE** merely because code exists.

**DONE** requires the relevant dimensions to pass:

1. Code implemented
2. Automated tests
3. Real / provider UAT where applicable
4. Operator UX usable
5. Async / background-safe where long-running
6. Security / provenance checked
7. Known blockers resolved
8. Canonical documentation updated

Use explicit states such as:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PLANNED` | Direction accepted; no meaningful product code |
| `IMPLEMENTING` | Active work; not ready to treat as main capability |
| `CODE COMPLETE` | Code on target branch; tests/UAT/UX may lag |
| `TESTED` | Automated tests cover the capability on main |
| `UAT REQUIRED` | Needs real provider / operator verification |
| `UAT PASS` | Real/provider UAT recorded as pass for the scoped slice |
| `PARTIAL` | Meaningful subset only; gaps are explicit |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot proceed without resolving a named blocker |
| `DONE` | Meets Definition of Done for the scoped slice |

**Avoid** using “Implemented V1” as a synonym for **DONE**.

Technical version labels (for example Agent 1.0.0, “Intelligence V1”) remain valid as **version identifiers**, not completion claims.

Reconcile claims against `PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md` before asserting completeness.

## Source priority

Preserve MASTER_SPEC supremacy while integrating project memory:

1. `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md` — product truth (highest)
2. Latest accepted ADRs (`docs/foundation/DECISION_LOG.md`)
3. `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` — persistent product / architecture memory (this file; does not override MASTER_SPEC)
4. Relevant `docs/product/*` / module blueprints
5. `PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md` — **implementation truth** (coded / tested / UAT / UX / async)
6. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
7. `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
8. `AGENTS.md` / supporting references (`docs/foundation/*`, `docs/module-sdk/*`, research)

`docs/current-state/*` remains **historical** snapshot material. On conflict with the sources above, current-state loses.

When behavior or capability state changes, update `PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md` in the **same PR**.  
When material product / architecture decisions change, update `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` in the **same PR**.
